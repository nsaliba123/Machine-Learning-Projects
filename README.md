The three projects include the following models: Trend Following, Hierarchical Risk Parity, and Hedge Fund Replication. The indicators.py file is used for the Trend Following model, and the two Excel files are used for the Hedge Fund Replication model.

Hedge Fund Replication: This model uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to replicate hedge fund returns with ETFs. The goal is to find ETFs that closely match the performance of various hedge funds.
XGBoost Trend Following: This model leverages XGBoost to build a trading model based on technical indicators. The position size is determined by the probability of a buy or sell signal generated by the model. The technical indicators used for this strategy are defined in the indicators.py file.
Risk Parity: This model implements Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) to create a diversified risk-parity portfolio. What's unique about this model is that fixed income is broken into three segments: short duration, floating rate, and long duration bonds. The dendrogram at the bottom of the model output shows which assets provide maximum diversification. Additionally, it demonstrates superior returns compared to a traditional inverse-variance portfolio.
The ultimate goal is to combine these strategies into a robust multi-strategy portfolio for enhanced diversification and risk-adjusted returns.
